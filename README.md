# My Exercise - Democracy Works Submission

This project starts to build out functionality to allow users to search for upcoming elections based on their address.

Initially, users will be able to search by state and city name.

# Future features
In the future, I would like to add the ability to search for types of elections (Federal, State, Local).

# Notes

This project is the first time I've used Clojure, and I'm excited to get a better understanding of the flow of data within this application and the opportunities for Clojure provides.
